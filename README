The zipped Speech Folder must be unzipped before running anything.

Running main.py will extract all of the features from our data and train the three classifiers
(SVC, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier).

This process will store the trained classifiers in joblibs. Additionally, the features extracted and labels will be
stored in csv files so that the entire feature extraction does not need to be performed once again.

Running RealWorldTester.py will perform classification and rearrangement of whatever .wav file is in the folder
SpeechFolder/Test/BriefTest (this is currently the introduction to "Our Song").
